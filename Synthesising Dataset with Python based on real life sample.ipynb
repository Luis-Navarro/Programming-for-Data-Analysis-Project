    "Firstly, using the **iloc** method, the first 5 columns were left out of the DataFrame. Those columns included different geographical codes with no actual meaning for the purpose of this project. Upon checking on the file, an extra row at the end of the file was detected. This row does not belong to the data set, since the only value is a number under a categorical column. This row is considered as a mistake and therefore, is also eliminated by slicing it out of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way for removing columns was the **drop** method, in which column names to be deleted from the DataFrame were listed. In this case, additional geographical codification was removed, although *NUTS_III* and *County* remained for reference purposes, but since these are categoriacal variables, will not be used to estimate distribution statistics. The original dataset includes not only frequencies for different aspects of Irish language usage, but also calculations over these frequencies. In this case, these frequencies were calculated as percentages, but we do not need that calculations for our purpose. Therefore, all columns including percentual calculations over frequencies were eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the documentation, *axis=1* was introduced in order to specify that the registries to eliminate were columns in our DataFrame. Additionally, since the objective is to modify the actual DataFrame, the *inline* parameter was set to ***True***.\n",
